            <h1>welcome to deadfry42's pokedex tracker!</h1>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>This website is a simple and easy to use Pokedex tracker for Pokemon games. It even supports Pokemon Box: Ruby & Sapphire!</p>
            <p>There will likely be more games that this website supports, but as of now, during its development stages, it only will have data for that game.</p>
            <p>This website is only possible due to the amazing efforts of the Pokemon community, and uses PokeAPI to source its sprites and Bulbapedia to get information for each pokemon.</p>
            <p>This website is in no way affiliated with The Pokemon Company International, Gamefreak, Nintendo and/or Creatures inc.</p>
            <p>There used to be a predecessor to this website, originally called funny-pt (funny-pokedex tracker). This is its successor. The old website relied on firebase to store pokemon data, and an externally hosted server to provide sprites and images. That server is long gone, and the old website is incredibly insecure, outdated and incomplete. That is why this website uses localstorage to save data, and uses other services to provide that information.</p>
            <p>This website is entirely open source! Check out the source code <a href="https://github.com/deadfry42/pokedex-tracker" style="color: white;">here</a>!</p>
