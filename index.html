            <h1>welcome to deadfry42's pokedex tracker!</h1>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>This is a simple tracker designed for the not-so-popular Pokemon Box: Ruby and Sapphire for the Gamecube. Other games may be supported in the future!</p>
            <p>The reason this was created was due to the lack of Pokedex trackers for the afforementioned game, and because my older version (called funny-pokedextracker) started to fail. It was also designed badly, and led to awful maintainability.</p>
            <p>Everything is saved in your browser, and can be exported and imported as you please. This is done to not have to deal with external servers that could be hacked and or be shut off. Your data will not be sent to any 3rd party because of this.</p>
            <p>Thanks to PokeAPI for providing an easy to use api for pokemon data (and sprites) and Bulbapedia for providing pokemon data/information</p>
            <p>This website is entirely open source! Check out the source code <a href="https://github.com/deadfry42/pokedex-tracker" style="color: white;">here</a>!</p>
