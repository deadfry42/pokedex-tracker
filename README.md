## What is this?
This is a simple and easy to use Pokedex tracker for the pokemon games. Currently, only Pokemon Box: Ruby & Sapphire is supported. This will likely change, as this website is designed around being modular and easy to maintain (unlike the old one).

## How does it work?
Unlike the predecessor, this pokedex tracker saves all of its data in localstorage, which means the data never leaves your device (unless you explicitly share it). This is an upside, but also a downside, as it won't sync between devices and (on certain browsers like safari) may be cleared out after 1 week of inactivity. Both can be (sort of) solved by allowing the user to export and import data as they please.

## Credits
I would like to give credit to PokeAPI for providing a large repository of pokemon sprites for use, and for Bulbapedia for providing an amazing database of every Pokemon and all of it's data. This project would not be possible without these 2 sources.
