## What is this?
This is a simple and easy to use Pokedex tracker for the pokemon games. Currently, It supports Generation 1 through 3. There are plans to support all generations in the future, but this project is relatively new and isn't quite yet complete.

## How does it work?
Unlike the predecessor, this pokedex tracker saves all of its data in localstorage, which means the data never leaves your device (unless you explicitly share it). This is an upside, but also a downside, as it won't sync between devices and (on certain browsers like safari) may be cleared out after 1 week of inactivity. Both can be (sort of) solved by allowing the user to export and import data as they please.
