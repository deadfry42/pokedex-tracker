A simple and easy to use FOSS Pokedex tracker!

## What is this?
This is a simple and easy to use Pokedex tracker for the pokemon games. Currently, only Pokemon Box: Ruby & Sapphire is supported. This will likely change, as this website is designed around being modular and easy to maintain, unlike the old one.

## Credits
I would like to give credit to PokeAPI for providing a large repository of pokemon sprites for use, and for Bulbapedia for providing an amazing database of every Pokemon and all of it's data. This project would not be possible without these 2 sources.
