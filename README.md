## What is this?
This is a very extensive but relatively simple to use Pokedex tracker for the pokemon games. Currently, It supports Generations 1 through 3. There are plans to support all generations in the future, but this project is relatively new and isn't quite yet complete.

## How does it work?
This pokedex tracker is quite simple. You can select the game you'd like to track, and then click on the pokemon mark it as "obtained" and click again to unmark it. You can also right-click to give it a mark, and right-click again to take its mark away. Furthermore, it is incredibly customisable with a lot of options.
